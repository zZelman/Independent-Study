This project is a real-time strategy 2D tower defense video game where the player builds, maintains, and defends a central tower from the AI opponent.

This game is not intended to be graphically advanced, instead it is an example of my personal coding style and abilities. Therefore, the strengths of this project will be in the algorithms, data structures, and overall clean code.
